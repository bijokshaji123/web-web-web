<h1>DIWALI: THE FESTIVAL OF LIGHTS</h1>
<img src="diwali.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 700px;" alt="Diwali">
<p>Diwali, or Dipawali, is India's biggest and most important holiday of the year. The festival 
gets its name from the row (avali) of clay lamps (deepa) that Indians light outside their homes 
to symbolize the inner light that protects from spiritual darkness. This festival is as important 
to Hindus as the Christmas holiday is to Christians. Over the centuries, Diwali has become a 
national festival that's also enjoyed by non-Hindu communities. For instance, in Jainism, 
Diwali marks the nirvana, or spiritual awakening, of Lord Mahavira on October 15, 527 B.C.; 
in Sikhism, it honors the day that Guru Hargobind Ji, the Sixth Sikh Guru, wasfreed from 
imprisonment. Buddhists in India celebrate Diwali as well. </p>

<h1>ONAM: THE HARVEST FESTIVAL OF KERALA</h1>
<img src="onam.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 700px;" alt="onam">
<p>The festival of Onam is celebrated throughout the state of Kerala. Kerala during Onam is 
marked by happiness, excitement and enjoyment among all sections of people. Onam is 
celebrated as an outcome of reasons that have to do with mythology as well as old agrarian 
practices. If one is to go by the myth, then King Mahabali or Maveli was a generous and 
virtuous ruler, who had once ruled Kerala. This occasion is celebrated by all Keralites as Onam. 
And the other cause for celebrating Onam is because it is the time of the year when a good 
harvest has been gathered all over Kerala, resulting in plenitude and happiness. </p>
