Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) disseminate 
their seeds.Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans 
and animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one
group and nutrition for the other; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent 
on fruits as a source of food

<p><i><h3 style="color:#FF7A59; text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman;"> 
Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. The 
original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all 
edible plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. An 
alternative definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and 
cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, 
nuts, and cereal grains, but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers 
such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.

<p><i><h3 style="color:#FF7A59; text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman;"> A 
flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in 
flowering plants(plants of the division Angiospermae). The biological function of a flower 
is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with 
eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different 
individuals in a population) resulting from cross-pollination or allow selfing (fusion of 
sperm and egg from the same flower) when self-pollination occurs.

<p><i><h3 style="color:#FF7A59; text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman;"> 
In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting 
branches and leaves. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including
only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a 
specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are 
also trees. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have 
independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to
compete for sunlight.
